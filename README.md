This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# General Knowedge Quiz - GA Project Two 

### Goal and timeframe 

- The second project was pair coded hackathon; 48 hours to create a React app that consumed a public API 

### Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML5 
- SCSS
- Axios
- Yarn 
- Bulma 
- Insomnia 

### Process

We started by searching for a free public API to use without an access key. After we had found our General Knowledge API we hooked it upto Insomnia and starting making REST request to make sure we would access the data we needed. 

- Created a wireframe for the quiz including pseudo code for the correct/wrong answers logic
- Building out our components for the quiz: homepage, quiz and results
- Building out logic for the quiz 

- INSERT snippet of code here

### Challenges 
- Accessing the data, it was very embedded 
- Array manipulation /

### Reflection 
- This was a fantastic learning experience, particularly in collaboration, wireframing, problem solving and API consumption.
- I realised the benefits of pair coding; efficiently solve/ talk through problems; thinking algorithmically and breaking big problems into smaller parts.
- I massively increased my knowledge of API consumtion and API end points.
